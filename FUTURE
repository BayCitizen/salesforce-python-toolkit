- Support for client certificates

- Support for Metadata client
  - solution at http://www.threepillarsoftware.com/soap_client_auth

- Support for WSDL caching
  - The default location (directory) is /tmp/suds so Windows users will need
    to set the location to something that makes sense on Windows. 
    - Is this still the case?
  - Suds may be caching remote WSDLs automatically - check on this

- SOAP compression (decompression not yet implemented by Suds)
  - Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

- persistent connections
  - not supported as of urllib2 version in Python 3.1
    - see comment in do_open() in Lib/urllib/request.py (or Lib/urllib2.py for Python 2.x)
